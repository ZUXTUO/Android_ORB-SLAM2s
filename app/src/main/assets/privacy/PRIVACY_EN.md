# ORB-SLAM2s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

**Last Updated: August 17, 2026**

---

## 1. Project Overview

**ORB-SLAM2s** is an Android-based enhanced spatial computing and lightweight Augmented Reality (AR) demo software built upon ORB-SLAM2. The lowercase 's' in ORB-SLAM2s stands for **Smart · Swift · Small**, emphasizing enhanced intelligence, faster performance, and lighter weight compared to the original ORB-SLAM2.

This project combines computer vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology with Augmented Reality (AR) rendering capabilities to provide **6-Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) spatial positioning** on mobile devices. Core features include:

1. **Sparse Point Cloud SLAM Mapping**: Real-time extraction of ORB features from monocular camera input to construct sparse 3D point cloud maps of the environment;
2. **Map Persistence**: Saving constructed maps as binary files (.bin) with associated metadata (.json) to local device storage, and reloading them for future sessions;
3. **Relocalization & Matching**: Recovering camera pose through feature matching when loading existing maps;
4. **Confidence Visualization**: Visual tracking of keypoints and matching statistics between current frames and the loaded map;
5. **Plane Detection**: Intelligent detection of horizontal floors/surfaces based on current camera pose and point cloud data;
6. **Native AR Rendering**: Native 3D rendering via the lightweight C library **cgltf** (GLB/glTF model parsing) and OpenGL ES 2.0, supporting placement and interaction of virtual objects on detected planes;
7. **Dark Frame Detection**: Automatic detection of overly dark environments, pausing SLAM tracking to prevent wasted computational resources and tracking loss;
8. **3D Object Interaction Management**: Support for placing, scaling (pinch gesture), and interacting with 3D AR objects;
9. **3DOF Orientation Tracking**: Three-degrees-of-freedom orientation tracking using onboard device sensors (Rotation Vector Sensor / Accelerometer + Magnetometer);
10. **Multi-Map Support**: Simultaneous loading, matching, and management of multiple map files;
11. **Fully Decoupled IPC Architecture & Open Secondary Development**: The core SLAM computation engine is completely decoupled into an isolated background process service (`:slam_process`), communicating with UI and rendering pipelines via zero-copy shared memory (SharedMemory/Ashmem double-buffering) and asynchronous AIDL IPC. This architecture fully separates computation from rendering, exposes a clean, standardized IPC client interface, and enables secondary editing, custom algorithm backend replacements, and third-party host engine integrations.

This project **only** runs on the Android mobile platform. Its underlying SLAM engine is implemented in C/C++ (running in the isolated `:slam_process` service), while the upper layer uses Java/Kotlin for user interface and AR rendering pipelines, coordinating via high-performance local Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

## 2. User Privacy Consent Mechanism

The application includes a built-in privacy consent screen (`PrivacyConsentActivity`) that is displayed when the app is launched for the first time. The consent process works as follows:

1. **First Launch**: On initial startup, the app loads this Privacy Policy (selecting the appropriate language — Chinese or English — based on the device's system language setting).
2. **Scroll-to-Read Requirement**: The user must scroll through the full policy document. The "Agree" button remains disabled (grayed out) until the bottom of the document has been reached, ensuring the user has the opportunity to read the complete terms before giving consent.
3. **Consent Persistence**: Once the user taps "Agree", their consent is saved locally on the device via `SharedPreferences`. On subsequent launches, the privacy screen is skipped automatically.
4. **User Control**: If the user does not agree to the terms, they can exit the application by pressing the system back button.
5. **No Data Transmission**: This consent mechanism runs entirely on the local device. No consent status or any other data is transmitted to any remote server.

## 4. Permissions Requested and Usage Description

The following permissions are declared in AndroidManifest.xml. Each permission serves a specific and necessary purpose:

### 4.1 `android.permission.CAMERA`

- **Purpose**: Access the device rear camera to capture real-time video frames
- **Usage Location**: `CameraGLView.java` → `CameraX` framework → `ImageAnalysis.Analyzer`
- **Necessity**: **Core required permission**. SLAM system operation depends on real-time camera image acquisition for ORB feature extraction, camera trajectory estimation, and 3D point cloud map construction. Without this permission, SLAM and AR functionality cannot function.
- **Data Scope**: Only real-time video frames are acquired for image processing (grayscale and RGBA). No recording, uploading, or persistent storage of video streams occurs. Frame data exists temporarily in memory and is released immediately after processing.
- **Usage Scenario**: Throughout SLAM initialization, real-time tracking, plane detection, and AR rendering.
- **Rear Camera Only**: Uses only `CameraSelector.LENS_FACING_BACK` (rear camera); does not access the front camera.

### 4.2 `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`

- **Purpose**: Read saved SLAM map files, vocabulary files, and camera configuration files
- **Usage Location**: `NativeHelper.java` — `initSLAM()`, `loadMap()`, `loadMapWithId()`; `ZipHelper.java`
- **Necessity**: **Functionally required**. The app needs to read the ORB vocabulary file (`ORBvoc.txt.arm.bin`) and camera parameter configuration (`CameraSettings.yaml`) at startup; loading previously saved maps requires reading `.bin` and `.json` files.
- **Limitation**: `android:maxSdkVersion="32"` — Android 13+ (API 33+) will no longer grant this permission; the app will use scoped storage (`getExternalFilesDir()`) instead.
- **Storage Path**: Only accesses files under `getExternalFilesDir("SLAM")`; does not read other user private files.

### 4.3 `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`

- **Purpose**: Save SLAM map files (.bin) and metadata files (.json) to external storage
- **Usage Location**: `NativeHelper.MapManager.saveMap()`
- **Necessity**: **Functionally required**. When the user triggers "Save Map", the currently constructed sparse point cloud map is serialized and written to storage along with metadata (keyframe count, map point count, creation time, etc.).
- **Limitation**: `android:maxSdkVersion="32"` — Same as read permission; higher Android versions use scoped storage.
- **Written Content**: Only `.bin` (serialized map data) and `.json` (metadata description) file types.
- **Storage Path**: Only writes to the `getExternalFilesDir("SLAM/maps")` directory; does not modify other user files.

## 5. Hardware Feature Usage

### 5.1 Camera Hardware

| Item              | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Declaration**   | `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />`                                                                                          |
| **Purpose**       | Primary input source for SLAM real-time tracking and AR rendering. Resolution is dynamically computed (base 1280x720, maintain 16:9 aspect ratio). |
| **Data Pipeline** | CameraX `ImageAnalysis` outputs RGBA_8888 format frames → converted to OpenCV Mat objects (RGBA + Gray) → passed to JNI layer for SLAM processing. |

### 5.2 Autofocus

| Item            | Description                                                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Declaration** | `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" android:required="false" />`              |
| **Purpose**     | User tap-to-focus triggers center autofocus and metering, improving image quality and tracking stability. |
| **Optional**    | Marked as `required="false"` — devices without autofocus support can still use the camera normally.       |

### 5.3 Sensors (Runtime Usage, Not Declared in Manifest)

| Sensor Type                                       | Purpose                                             | Priority                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR** (Rotation Vector Sensor) | 3DOF orientation tracking, computes device 3D pose  | Primary                                 |
| **TYPE_ACCELEROMETER** (Accelerometer)            | Fallback when rotation vector sensor is unavailable | Secondary (combined with magnetometer)  |
| **TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD** (Magnetometer)            | Fallback when rotation vector sensor is unavailable | Secondary (combined with accelerometer) |

**Notes**:

- Sensor data sample rate is set to `SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_GAME` (game level, ~20ms interval);
- All sensor data is processed **locally on the device** and **is not uploaded, stored, or transmitted to any external location**;
- Sensor coordinate systems are remapped for landscape orientation to accommodate the app's fixed landscape display.

## 6. Data Collection and Privacy Protection

### 6.1 Data We Do NOT Collect

This project strictly adheres to the principle of data minimization. **We do NOT collect, record, transmit, or share any of the following information**:

- ❌ No personally identifiable information (name, ID number, phone number, email address, etc.);
- ❌ No device identifiers (IMEI, IMSI, MAC address, Android ID, advertising ID, etc.);
- ❌ No location information (GPS coordinates, WiFi positioning, cellular base station positioning, etc.);
- ❌ No biometric information (fingerprints, face, iris, etc.);
- ❌ No contacts, SMS, call logs, or calendar data;
- ❌ No app usage statistics or analytics data;
- ❌ No crash reports or telemetry data;
- ❌ No third-party advertising SDKs or analytics SDKs;
- ❌ No active connections to any remote servers.

### 6.2 Local Data Processing and Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

| Data Type                                | Processing Method                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Storage                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Camera frames**                        | Real-time processing: written to anonymous shared memory (Ashmem/SharedMemory double buffer), notifying the `:slam_process` process via oneway AIDL for processing. Frame data is overwritten/released by subsequent frames.                 | Not stored                                   |
| **Inter-Process Data Flow**              | Point cloud coordinates, MVP transformation matrices, and tracking states are exchanged between the main UI process and SLAM process via shared memory headers and memory mapping, entirely within local RAM with zero network transmission. | Not stored                                   |
| **SLAM maps (when user actively saves)** | Serialized as binary `.bin` files + `.json` metadata files                                                                                                                                                                                   | Saved to `getExternalFilesDir("SLAM/maps/")` |
| **Map metadata**                         | Includes: map name, keyframe count, map point count, creation timestamp, whether plane detection exists                                                                                                                                      | Same as above                                |
| **ORB vocabulary**                       | Pre-packaged file, used for feature matching (read-only)                                                                                                                                                                                     | `getExternalFilesDir("SLAM/")`               |
| **Camera calibration config**            | Pre-packaged file (read-only)                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `getExternalFilesDir("SLAM/")`               |
| **Log information**                      | Outputs debug logs via Android Logcat, visible only in developer mode                                                                                                                                                                        | System log buffer (circular overwrite)       |

### 6.3 Crash Handling

This application **does not include any custom crash collection mechanism**. When the application crashes, the Android system default behavior applies (displaying the "App has stopped" dialog).

- Benefiting from the **IPC process decoupling architecture**, the native SLAM algorithm runs in an independent `:slam_process`. If the underlying algorithm encounters an extreme out-of-memory or native crash, the host UI process can detect the disconnection via `ServiceConnection` and degrade gracefully, preventing a full application crash;
- The application itself **does NOT collect, store, or upload any crash information** to any remote server;
- The Android system may, with the user's explicit consent, collect basic crash stack information for system diagnostic purposes (this behavior is controlled by the Android system and is unrelated to this application).

### 6.4 Third-Party Library Data Handling

All third-party libraries used by this project run locally on the device and do not involve data transmission:

- **OpenCV**: Image processing (feature extraction, matrix operations), all executed locally on the CPU;
- **ORB-SLAM2 Core (C++)**: SLAM algorithm engine, encapsulated in `:slam_process` and executed entirely locally;
- **srrg_hbst (HBST)**: Hierarchical binary search tree for image matching and relocalization, all executed locally;
- **cgltf**: Lightweight C glTF/GLB model parser paired with OpenGL ES for AR 3D rendering, executed entirely locally;
- **Google Guava / AndroidX**: System utility classes, not involved with user data;
- **Markwon**: Markdown rendering library used solely for displaying the Privacy Policy within the app, all executed locally.

## 7. Security Considerations

1. **App Signing**: APK/AAB distributions of this application should be signed with the developer's private key to ensure integrity and trustworthy source.
2. **Data Isolation**: All application data is stored in the app's `getExternalFilesDir()` sandbox directory, with access restricted by the Android system.
3. **Process Isolation & Security Boundary**: The SLAM core service runs in an isolated private process (`:slam_process`) declared with `android:exported="false"`. External unauthorized apps cannot bind to or invoke this service. The separation also delivers process-level fault isolation.
4. **Minimum Permissions**: Only the minimum permissions required for SLAM and AR functionality are requested; no extraneous permissions are declared.
5. **No Persistent Background Services**: The application has no persistent background services. All resources (camera, sensors, IPC bindings, GL context) are released upon exit.
6. **App Backup & Data Leakage Prevention**: The application's `AndroidManifest.xml` declares `android:allowBackup="true"` for convenience. On Android 12+ (API 31+), users can disable backup in device settings to prevent map files and app data from being included in system backups. Users handling sensitive mapping data should consider disabling app backup.
7. **Native Code Crash Handling**: The application's C++ native layer includes a signal handler framework that intercepts native crashes (e.g., SIGSEGV, SIGABRT) to produce diagnostic logs. These logs are written only to the Android Logcat buffer (accessible solely in developer/debug mode) and are never collected, stored, or transmitted by the application itself. This mechanism is provided solely for debugging purposes during development.
